2. **Product Category Analysis**  
   - Uses a **bar chart** and a **pie chart** to summarize the quantity of products sold by category.  
   - The **bar chart** provides a clearer visualization compared to the pie chart, which can be harder to interpret. The number of products displayed in the pie chart was limited to **12** for better readability and visual clarity.

   - The **map chart** interacts with the bar and pie charts, allowing users to dynamically explore sales data by city and category.
